PrivacyCryptoWallet
PrivacyCryptoWallet is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency wallet leveraging zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) technology to enable fully anonymous and secure transactions on the blockchain. This project aims to ensure transaction confidentiality and user privacy while providing a simple and user-friendly interface.

Features
1. Anonymous Transactions
Ensure complete anonymity for all transactions by concealing transaction details, including the sender, recipient, transaction history, and account balances.
With zk-SNARKs, the wallet allows users to transact securely and privately, protecting sensitive information from exposure on the blockchain.
2. Secure Transaction Verification
Verify the validity and integrity of transactions without revealing any underlying details.
The zk-SNARK-based approach guarantees that transactions are genuine while preserving full privacy, offering cryptographic proof of correctness.
3. User-Friendly Interface
Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, the wallet provides an intuitive and streamlined interface to enhance user experience.
Focus on a clean and straightforward layout that enables even non-technical users to navigate and perform transactions with ease.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React - A JavaScript library for building responsive and dynamic user interfaces, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Backend: Node.js and Express - Used to create RESTful APIs for managing transactions, user data, and zk-SNARK integration.
Blockchain and Smart Contracts: Solidity - The primary language for writing Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, essential for enabling anonymous and secure transactions.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs): snarkjs and circom - Libraries for implementing and verifying zk-SNARK proofs, critical for creating privacy-preserving transactions.
